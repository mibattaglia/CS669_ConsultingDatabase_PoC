# RepTrap_Database_PoC

This SQL script implements a relational database in Oracle SQL using blinded data from a consulting company where I was previously employed. As a proof of concept, I created a simple relational database for my Database Implementation and Design class to a) practice using SQL b) gain experience working through the full database implementation process c) show this as a "proof of concept" to company management that implementing a relational database is a necessity to faciliate easier data access.
